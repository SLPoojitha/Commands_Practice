Good day, everyone!

This is Poojitha, a CSE third year student at NITK Surathkal. I am from Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. Today, I am here to share my experience with all of you about the Oracle hiring process. This would be helpful for all the second years who will undergo this process this summer.

**Selection Procedure:** Round 1 - This was an MCQ test in which we had to solve about 70-80 questions in 107 minutes. All questions were divided into subsets. Each subset had its own time for solving. There were 4 subsets: 1. English and Communication Skills 2. Aptitude 3. OS, OOPS, DBMS, Networking 4. Data Structures (primarily focussed on Binary trees). Round 2 - Technical Interview (45 min): At first we had a brief discussion on my Projects then I was given a coding question on Strings that could be executed on any online platform. After that, the interviewer asked me to dry run on some special cases. At last, we had a small discussion on my Interests. Round 3 - Technical Interview (45 min): This interview was mainly focused on SQL and a few Algorithmic and Output based questions in C++ ( as I have mentioned in my resume). Then the interviewer concluded it with some general HR-based questions.

**My Preparation:** Initially, I practiced DSA from Leetcode and as time progresses I started using interview bit to make myself comfortable with time pressure. For OS and DBMS I used gate smashers and I referred to interview bit, w3.schools for OOPS.

**My Advice:** Make sure that your CS fundamental concepts are clear and be prepared with your resume as they might throw any question from it. Also, when you are given a coding question, don't just directly jump to solve it instead try to get clarified on some special cases and always put your thoughts in words.

Overall, it was an Amazing Experience. 

Thank you.
